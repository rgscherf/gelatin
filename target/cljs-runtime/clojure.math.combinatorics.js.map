However, when dealing with combinations and permutations, you're usually generating large numbers of things, and speed counts.  My objective was to write the fastest possible code I could, restricting myself to Clojure's functional, persistent data structures (rather than using Java's arrays) so that this code could be safely leveraged within Clojure's transactional concurrency system.\n\nI also restricted myself to algorithms that return results in a standard order.  For example, there are faster ways to generate cartesian-product, but I don't know of a faster way to generate the results in the standard nested-for-loop order.\n\nMost of these algorithms are derived from algorithms found in Knuth's wonderful Art of Computer Programming books (specifically, the volume 4 fascicles), which present fast, iterative solutions to these common combinatorial problems.  Unfortunately, these iterative versions are somewhat inscrutable.  If you want to better understand these algorithms, the Knuth books are the place to start.\n\"\n)\n\n#?(:cljs (def *' *)) ; because Clojurescript doesn't have *'\n#?(:cljs (def +' +)) ; because Clojurescript doesn't have +'\n\n(defn- join\n  \"Lazily concatenates a collection of collections into a flat sequence,\n  because Clojure's `apply concat` is insufficiently lazy.\"\n  [colls]\n  (lazy-seq\n   (when-let [s (seq colls)]\n     (concat (first s) (join (rest s))))))\n\n(defn- mapjoin\n  \"Uses join to achieve lazier version of mapcat (on one collection)\"\n  [f coll]\n  (join (map f coll)))\n\n(defn- all-different?\n  \"Annoyingly, the built-in distinct? doesn't handle 0 args, so we need\n  to write our own version that considers the empty-list to be distinct\"\n  [s]\n  (if (seq s)\n    (apply distinct? s)\n    true))\n\n(defn- index-combinations\n  [n cnt]\n  (lazy-seq\n    (let [c (vec (cons nil (for [j (range 1 (inc n))] (+ j cnt (- (inc n)))))),\n          iter-comb\n          (fn iter-comb [c j]\n            (if (> j n) nil\n              (let [c (assoc c j (dec (c j)))]\n                (if (< (c j) j) [c (inc j)]\n                  (loop [c c, j j]\n                    (if (= j 1) [c j]\n                      (recur (assoc c (dec j) (dec (c j))) (dec j)))))))),\n          step\n          (fn step [c j]\n            (cons (rseq (subvec c 1 (inc n)))\n                  (lazy-seq (let [next-step (iter-comb c j)]\n                              (when next-step (step (next-step 0) (next-step 1)))))))]\n      (step c 1))))\n\n;; Helper function for bounded-distributions\n(defn- distribute [m index total distribution already-distributed]\n  (loop [distribution distribution\n         index index\n         already-distributed already-distributed]\n    (if (>= index (count m)) nil\n      (let [quantity-to-distribute (- total already-distributed)\n            mi (m index)]\n        (if (<= quantity-to-distribute mi)\n          (conj distribution [index quantity-to-distribute total])\n          (recur (conj distribution [index mi (+ already-distributed mi)])\n                 (inc index)\n                 (+ already-distributed mi))))))) \n\n;; Helper function for bounded-distributions\n(defn- next-distribution [m total distribution]\n  (let [[index this-bucket this-and-to-the-left] (peek distribution)]\n    (cond\n      (< index (dec (count m)))\n      (if (= this-bucket 1)\n        (conj (pop distribution) [(inc index) 1 this-and-to-the-left])\n        (conj (pop distribution) \n              [index (dec this-bucket) (dec this-and-to-the-left)]\n              [(inc index) 1 this-and-to-the-left])),\n      ; so we have stuff in the last bucket\n      (= this-bucket total) nil\n      :else\n      (loop [distribution (pop distribution)],\n        (let\n          [[index this-bucket this-and-to-the-left] (peek distribution),\n           distribution (if (= this-bucket 1) \n                          (pop distribution)\n                          (conj (pop distribution)\n                                [index (dec this-bucket) (dec this-and-to-the-left)]))],\n          (cond\n            (<= (- total (dec this-and-to-the-left)) (apply + (subvec m (inc index))))       \n            (distribute m (inc index) total distribution (dec this-and-to-the-left)),\n            \n            (seq distribution) (recur distribution)\n            :else nil))))))\n      \n;; Helper function for multi-comb\n(defn- bounded-distributions\n  [m t]\n  (let [step \n        (fn step [distribution]\n          (cons distribution\n                (lazy-seq (when-let [next-step (next-distribution m t distribution)]\n                            (step next-step)))))]\n    (step (distribute m 0 t [] 0))))\n\n;; Combinations of multisets\n;; The algorithm in Knuth generates in the wrong order, so this is a new algorithm\n(defn- multi-comb\n  \"Handles the case when you want the combinations of a list with duplicate items.\"\n  [l t]\n  (let [f (frequencies l),\n        v (vec (distinct l)),\n        domain (range (count v))\n        m (vec (for [i domain] (f (v i))))\n        qs (bounded-distributions m t)]\n    (for [q qs]\n      (join\n       (for [[index this-bucket _] q]\n         (repeat this-bucket (v index)))))))\n                \n(defn combinations\n  \"All the unique ways of taking t different elements from items\"\n  [items t]      \n  (let [v-items (vec (reverse items))]\n    (if (zero? t) (list ())\n      (let [cnt (count items)]\n        (cond (> t cnt) nil\n              (= t 1) (for [item (distinct items)] (list item))\n              (all-different? items) (if (= t cnt) \n                                        (list (seq items))\n                                        (map #(map v-items %) (index-combinations t cnt))),\n              :else (multi-comb items t))))))\n\n(defn- unchunk\n  \"Given a sequence that may have chunks, return a sequence that is 1-at-a-time\nlazy with no chunks.
